* For beginners
  Learning Emacs is a life long journey. Start by reading the
  tutorial. Press C-h t to start the tutorial. This means: press
  Ctrl-h followed by t.
** basic configurations
   After reading the tutorial experiment with these basic
   customizations:

** Emacs documenation
*** Manual

*** Emacs lisp
    Leveraging the power of Emacs requires learning Emacs lisp.
    - quick introduction (*recommended*!) [[https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/elisp/][Learn X in Y minutes where X = elisp]]
    - GNU manual about learning elisp [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/eintr.html][An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp]]
    - [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/elisp.html][GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual]] (not really needed by beginners)
** org-mode
   After gaining some experience with Emacs you can start
   experimenting with org-mode. This package allows you to organize
   your life in plain text files.

   - [[http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html][org-mode setup by norang.ca]]
** configurations by Emacs power users
   These configurations are intimidating. I find them useful to gain
   new ideas. I didn't know there is even a google-translate package
   for Emacs!
